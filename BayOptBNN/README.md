This BayOptBNN is implemented based on the library [GPyOpt](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt) which implement bayesian optimization fitted with Gaussian Process.

The BayOptBNN function like following:
Use Bayesian Neural Network([BNN](https://github.com/yinyumeng/hyper_parameter_tuning/tree/master/bayesianneuralnetwork/bayesianneuralnetwork)) instead of Gaussian Process to get the range distribution of hyperParameters.
